## Abstract

Burn injuries pose a significant challenge in predicting the end result of the final wound healing of the burn. The aim of this study is to develop simulation models for the post-burn immune response based on existing (pre)clinical data from the literature. We developed an agent-based model (ABM) to capture the complexity associated with the dynamics of inflammation after burn injuries, including changes in cell counts and cytokine concentrations. Through simulations spanning a four-day period, we successfully captured significant factors influencing the inflammatory response, i.e., the initial number of endothelial cells, the chemotaxis threshold, and the intensity of chemoattractants. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of the initial cell count in shaping the intensity of inflammation, in determining the timeline of the inflammation, and the end result of wound healing.


## Software implementation


All source code used to generate the results and figures in the paper can be accessed by contacting the original authors.
The calculations and figure generation are all run in python3.10.
The data used in this study is provided in `/combi_code/datafiles` and the sources for the figures are in `manuscript`.
Results generated by the code are saved in `Paper_figures`.

Compucell3D 4.4.1 was also used here with the help of numpy and fipy packages.
